'{letter}' in Status Bar
=================

This is a generator that creates 26 variants of a simple add-on for FxOS,
in the Web Extensions format, that adds a colored letter to your statusbar.
Nothing else.

Each add-on has its own letter, its own color, and its own corresponding icon.

Installing
==========

* Install Python Imaging Library
* Build all 26 variants by launching `python build.py` from this directory.
* Upload any of the zip files it created in the `dist` directory to the Firefox
  Marketplace.
* Done!
